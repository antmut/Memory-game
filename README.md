## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

   Provided links were enough to accomplish the task

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

   The game itself was not challenging at all, thanks to the excellent step by step explaination structure, which
   includes a lot of additional resourses provided. For the GitHub, gif and video creation I feel a lot better, since
   I am currently enrolled in a codepath course, which provides a lot of practice through weekly labs.
   Maybe the only challenge was spearing time to read all the materials and links provided, which I did enjoy.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   Google provides a lot of resources and tutorials in web development, but since I recently started, which book
   would you recommend as a must have in the personal library and why?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   If I had more time, I would go over all the optional features. Upgarading logic in functions and implementing
   more functions, as well as better understanding the single tones and sequences. There is a lot more to learn from
   this project.
